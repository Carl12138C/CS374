        \nDeveloper Comment: In similar fashion to Roadhog\'s Chain Hook combo changes last season, we\'d generally like to avoid heroes in the Tank role from killing enemies in one shot.
        \nEarthshatter direct hit damage is being reduced with that goal in mind.
        \nIn most cases, targets on the receiving end would die anyway during the knockdown stun, but it does open up some potential for their allies to intervene.
        \nFor now, we\'re fine with Charge pin staying lethal to many characters due to the difficulty and risk involved.
        \nThe Fire Strike damage increase does mean it could once again one-shot when combined with Baptiste\'s Amplification Matrix, but that requires an ultimate combo with another hero. We\'ll see how it plays out and adjust if necessary.
        \nThe Rocket Hammer knockback reduction sounds like a loss of power though it is actually aiming to reduce the number of times Reinhardt accidentally knocks enemies out of his melee range.</string>
